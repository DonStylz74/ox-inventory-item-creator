I have crerated this PS script to help create ox items quickly and easily.

Simple to use. run the exe files. and fill in the details you want to add for your item.
any fields that have not been filled out wont be added to the final item data.

eg.  if you dont fill in the server export data it wont be added to the final export file.

Items will be exported to a .lua file for ease of transfer from file to ox inventory items file.

Plenty of fields for item creation. (see Image)
